# Metrology
Welcome to the metrology repo!

I intend to fill this repo with any resources you might need to replicate my experiments. Also included will be resources used for scientific plotting in Blender.

Because there will be large files, it is assumed that [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) is installed. If you're using [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop), don't worry about it.
