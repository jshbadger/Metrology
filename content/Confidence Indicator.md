# Confidence Indicator
An important metric that often needs to be inferred is an authors confidence in a subject. In one scenario, an author writes boldly about a subject they know nothing about. In another, an author writes timidly about a subject they've spent decades perfecting.

When I indicate my confidence in a subject, I am answering the question, "If you were asked by an expert on this topic, how confident would you be in your answers?"

1 = No confidence; I just started learning about this.

2 = I have a good grasp of the basic principles. Nothing advanced.

3 = I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals, but I'm not an expert. I may have checked with an expert.

4 = I know what I'm doing, or I've been given an expert's approval for what I'm talking about.

5 = I'm an expert.

Each page on this website should have a confidence indicator at the top of the page. If it does not, please [let me know](https://jacobstewart.org/contact/).
## Confidence vs Expertise
*Confidence* is a matter of belief. *Expertise* is a matter of experience. 
I can always tell you how well *I believe* I know a subject, but I can't always tell you how much expertise I or my resources have. That would require me to be an expert, which, chances are, I'm not.
Therefore, even though I might indicate a high confidence score, that doesn't necessarily mean that there is much expertise involved.
In some cases, expertise is irrelevant; a mathematical proof is valid no matter how much expertise, assuming the math uses sound logic.
However, especially in cases of speculation, expertise is a valuable asset for accuracy.
I will try to provide indications of expertise through my writing (e.g., "resource from pioneer in field"), but the reader will likely need to discern expertise themselves.
