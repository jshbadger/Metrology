# What is this?
This website should show you the basics of metrology. 

Most of the time when people talk about metrology today, they are referring to machining or standards for units.

Though these aren't *wrong* ways of thinking about metrology, they're more of applications of metrology.

What I want to discover, explore, and share is the *theory* of measurement.

Why do we know what we do?

How do scientists take measurements?

What methods of measurement are used in astronomy, biomedicine, and so on?

*That* is what is covered on this website.
